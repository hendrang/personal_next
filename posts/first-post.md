This is my first post on this new site! Learning React has been on my list for awhile. It is always fun and exciting for me learning new things. I've decided to start my focus on Next JS client side rendering. Following the tutorial, I can see why many front-end developers love React. Now, I understand why developers' satisfaction is quite high with React.

Along the way, I also discovered Bulma (CSS, not DragonBall). Here I am being late in the game again (as usual). This CSS framework definitely fits my need for my side project. I have always struggled with the idea of starting CSS from scratch every time I started a new project. With Bulma, I don't have to anymore. It's like Bootstrap, which I've been using, but without JQuery or other JavaScript.

I would like to post more of what I've learned so far. If you know me, I am a believer that technologies are out there to make our life simpler and more productive. I can see that in both React/Next JS and Bulma. If you agree, stay tune for my future post. In the meantime, I would like to give credit to below sites:
