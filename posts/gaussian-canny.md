##### Background
A little bit about me... I have been following NBA since I was a child growing up in Indonesia. Aside from watching and playing basketball, I was also very active collecting basketball cards. Whenever I have some spare time and money, you can find me splurge a little bit into box breaking. Certain cards definitely have values in the market, especially if they are BGS or PSA graded. 

Having looked into how BGS and PSA grade cards, I was curious to see if could automate at least small part of the grading method, specifically the edges. Sharp corner edges will definitely increase your chance to have at least 8/10 grade. The idea here is to evaluate as best as we can as amateur graders before mailing our cards to the pro. 

##### How-to and Current Conclusion

I did explore OpenCV, Gaussian blur, and canny algorithm. My goal was to find the right edge points. I ended up not going anywhere with my attempt. Regardless, I would love to share my experience. I know that pythagorean theorem could also help me with the next step to come up with my own amateur grading. Anyway, more to come on this...
