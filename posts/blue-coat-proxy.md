##### Background
I'm sure everyone knows about companies blocking their employees to visit certain sites. One approach they know about a site is by looking at the category when that website is registered. Categories that are typically blocked: adult/mature content, social networking, gambling... you get the idea. How about if the site is just your personal site as a way for you to promote yourself? You are blocked not because you are part of the black list categories, but simply because you have not add category to your site.

##### How-to

All I have to do is to fill out my website information and category on this <a target="blank" href="https://sitereview.bluecoat.com">site</a>. Of course, let's be a good citizen and fill out the form as honest as possible.
