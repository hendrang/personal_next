I have launched my side business site, <a target="blank" href="https://tolektor.com">Tolektor</a>. One of the feature I have been working on is to provide my users with rank of popular player names sold on Ebay on particular date. There are few things I found out:

- Having code hitting well established sites will actually get stopped. I guess these sites can figure out that normal user will not be able to GET information that fast.
- Gathering and processing data can be quite a challenge. I am loving this right now. Even though it can be tedious, I am seeing this as opportunity to do more string manipulation.
- String is a beauty and a beast.
